\section{Experiment settings}
\label{sec:experiments}

We have already separated the dataset into training and testing. In this
section we describe the methods used for the estimation: {\em Linear
Regression}, {\em Support Vector Machine}, {\em Random Forest}, {\em
Boosting}, and a model that handle missing data simultaneously with the
fitting, using the {\em Expectation Maximization}.
