\subsection{Method X}

The method X has XXX hyperparameters that need to be defined. Time-series
split combined with random grid search was used to obtain the optimal numbers.
We defined the range to be XXX. The number os iterations chosen to run the
random search is XXX. Table XXX shows the results of the random search.
