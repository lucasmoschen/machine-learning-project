\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\BL{A}ir quality is a growing concern and area
of research because most cities worldwide have been facing problems with it in
the past few decades \cite{mayer1999}. The rapid increase of the urban
population and the development of the centers is causing environmental
pollution, which can give rise to damage to human health. 

The emission and transmission of air pollutants, such as, for example, Nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$), Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O$_3$) and, Particulate Matter (PM), result in ambient air pollution and are caused by different factors. The World Health
Organization (WHO) explained \cite{who2006} that PM, O$_3$, and NO$_2$ have, respectively, the
heaviest effects on human health.

In Rio de Janeiro, the city hall recognized the problem and created the
Program MonitorAr-Rio in 2008 \cite{relatorio2011}. The objective was to monitor the air quality, verify the degree of exposure of the population to the pollutants, and inform the community of the results.
Eight fixed stations monitor the pollutants defined in the legislation,
and some meteorological conditions, such as, for example, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind. 

It is fundamental to have up-to-date knowledge and accurate predictions of air pollutants to assist in the formulation of public health and
environmental policies. This study proposes models for hourly air
quality forecasting for the city of Rio de Janeiro. 

The text is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:problem-definition} defines
the problem clearly and mathematically. Section \ref{sec:background} gives a
background on the topic of air quality and air pollution. Section \ref{sec:methodology} presents
the methodology of the work. Section \ref{sec:eda} contains a description of the data used in this
work and an exploratory data analysis with the
data path. Section \ref{sec:experiments} presents the
methods used and the experiments related to each one. Sections
\ref{sec:results}, \ref{sec:discussion}, and \ref{sec:conclusion} end the text
with the main results and conclusions. 


\section{Problem definition}
\label{sec:problem-definition}

\BL We want to produce time predictions of some pollutants [See Section
\ref{sec:polluting-gases} for a detailed description] for Rio de Janeiro
city, considering the weather, location, and time variables. We also want to
develop a method for estimating the air quality of not monitored regions by
the program based on the monitored ones.

Let $Y_i$ be a random
variable indicating the quantity of i$^{th}$ pollutant measured in a specific
monitoring station, for instance, the quantity of ozone. If $\bb{X} \in \mathcal{X}
\subseteq \R^{p}$ is the random vector of meterological conditions measured,
$t$ is the time of measurement, and $s_1, ..., s_8$ the positions of the
monitoring stations, then it is measured 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:problem definition}
    Y_i = f_i(t, s_k, \bb{X}) + \epsilon_{t,s_k,i}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{t,s,i}$ is a random variable with mean zero. After
observing, for $t_1 < ... < t_n$,
$$y_i^{t_1,s}, ..., y_i^{t_n,s}$$ 
and 
$$
\bb{x}^{t_1,s}, ..., \bb{x}^{t_n,s},
$$
we want to predict $y_i^{t+1, s}$.
