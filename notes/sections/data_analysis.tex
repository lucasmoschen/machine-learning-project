\section{Exploratory data analysis}
\label{sec:eda}

\subsection{Data description}

\BL{T}he dataset used in this study was extracted from the project MonitorAr-Rio
\cite{dataset-rio-ar-quality}. The table contains hourly data observations, separated by
pollutant, weather condition, and monitoring stations' characteristics from
the city of Rio de Janeiro. Table
\ref{tab:measured-data} informs the most important variables used, and Table
\ref{tab:pollutants-measured} indicates the measured pollutants per monitoring
station. The events start on January 1,
2011,
and end on March 31, 2021, totalizing 661,662 records.

The missing values (Table \ref{tab:missing-values}) for each of the main variables used in this work 
are around 10\%. Some meteorological variables have more than 10\% of missing values, which is a lot.
The CO gas has more missing values than the other gases because Pedra de
Guaratiba does not measure it. When this kind of absent value is disregarded,
CO has around 6\%. Imputation methods in Section \ref{sec:data-preprocessing}.

Almost 91\% of the values in {\tt Chuva} column and 26\% in {\tt RS} column are zero. If we consider the accumulated monthly amount of
rain, it seems to make sense, and it is comparable to other sources. 

We did not observe any pattern of missing values per year or monitoring
station. In 2012, over half of the wind information is missing, however other
features are stable. After 2016, UR dominates the number of absent
data. If we aggregate by time (hour, day, month, and year), and sum up the
values of the features of each station, there are less missing data,
proportionally. This
implies that other stations can provide useful information.

Table \ref{tab:statistics-variables} contains the summary statistics of the variables. The high skewness and kurtosis from {\tt
Chuva} column reaffirm the heavy tails of its distribution, or the presence of
outliers. The same occurs with {\tt Press}. This is interesting because, it is common to see days with
extreme values in meteorological variables. In particular, the only hours with
precipitation greater than 100 mm were in May 2020 in Tijuca, what is
confirmed by weather references \cite{climatempo}. CO and PM$_{10}$ have high
kurtosis also and, therefore, can have outliers.

The time series of the three gases are presented in Figure
\ref{fig:time-series-gases}. It indicates growth in ozone levels during the
years and a seasonal effect, which corroborates the way ozone is formed.  It
also seems there is a decrease in variability in CO and PM$_{10}$ levels. The
year 2020 shows a reduction in CO apparently, which is explained by the
Coronavirus pandemic. 

We confirm the tendencies of PM$_{10}$ and O$_3$ in Figure \ref{fig:time-series-gases-year}. It is important to note that
2021 is not finished, so seasonal effects are not complete yet.

\end{figure}

By Figure \ref{fig:histogram-obs-years}, years 2011 and 2021 have less
observations than the others. The year 2021 did not end as previously
mentioned and the year 2011 had less monitoring stations.

Figure \ref{fig:correlation-features} shows an overview of the correlations
between different features of the data to identify possible linear relations.
The scatter plots of two to two features represents it with more details, but
there is much data, and the image has a large size. It does not present anything
much different, though. The variables {\tt Temp}, {\tt UR}, and {\tt RS} are
strongly linearly related with absolute correlation greater than 0.6.

Figure \ref{fig:hourly-boxplot-ozone} shows an interesting behavior of ozone during the day. For each hour of the day, we represent the distribution of ozone in the respective hour. We
observe that (1) the pollutants have heavy tail, or this data has a lot of
outliers; and (2) the medians go along with the movement of the sun.

\subsection{Data preprocessing}
\label{sec:data-preprocessing}

The data preprocessing is an essencial step before the usage of machine
learning algorithms, in order to report robust and neat results. Data from
year 2020 and 2021 will be removed given the pandemic in the world. 

\subsubsection{Seasonal and time features}

From variable {\tt Data}, it is extracted the variables {\tt year, month,
day}, {\tt hour}, a boolean variable indicating the weekend, and a {\tt season} variable. In
order to consider the hourly seasonality, it is created the variables
$\text{hour\_sin} = \sin(2\pi \text{ hour}/24)$ and $\text{hour\_cos} =
\cos(2\pi \text{ hour}/24)$. 

\subsubsection{Missing data imputation}

In this dataset, there is two types of missing data: (1) monitoring stations
do not measure all pollutants by construction. For instance, it is not
measured CO in Pedra de Guaratiba; and (2) monitoring stations did not
measure in a period for some reason. For the first case, missing values remain
in the dataset and the prediction is not performed. For the second case, three
methods were compared:  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Simple mean imputation:} For each year and each column, the
    algorithm imputes the mean in the NaN values. 
    \item {\bf Location:} For each time period, the missing values are
    replaced by the average among the others measuring stations. For example, if
    CO is missing at 6h on 01/01/2011 at Centro station, it is replaced by the
    mean among the other stations in the same time. 
    \item {\bf k-NN:} For each year, if a feature is missing in row $i$, the
    algorithm selects the $k$ closer points according to the nan euclidean
    measure. This measure calculates the euclidean distance among non NaN
    entries and rescale depending on the number of them. The years are
    separated to reduce the number of rows.
\end{enumerate}

The data values are normalized to the range of $[0,1]$, because k-NN is based
on a distance measure. To evaluate these methods, we develop a sample strategy
similar to the Bootstrap method. In each simulation, we sample 20\% of rows with
non NaN values and randomly choose 7\% of the cells to be removed (this value
was chosen because this was observed across the entire dataset). From the simulated
dataset with missing values, the methods impute as explained before. We
compare the imputed sample after imputation with the sample before removal and calculate
the mean squared error. The results for the year 2016 are in Table \ref{tab:result-imputation}. 

\begin{table}[!hb]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Método}   & \textbf{MSE} \\ \hline
    5-NN              & 6.504e-04    \\ \hline
    10-NN             & 6.504e-04    \\ \hline
    30-NN             & 6.504e-04    \\ \hline
    50-NN             & 6.504e-04    \\ \hline
    100-NN            & 6.504e-04    \\ \hline
    Location          & 1.077e-03    \\ \hline
    Simple Imputation & 1.636e-03    \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Results from the imputation}
    \label{tab:result-imputation}
\end{table}

For that reason, we apply the 5-NN in the dataset per year to impute data. It
is important to note that the computation was a real barrier for a more deep
analysis. 

\subsubsection{Data transformation}
\label{sec:data-transform}

We applied the Yeo-Johnson power transform \cite{yeo2000} on continuous
variables in order to approximate the data distribution to a Gaussian
distribution and to
decrease the heteroscedasticity, as suggested by \cite{gocheva2014}. In figure
\ref{fig:before-after-transform}, the gases distribution (disregarded
missing data imputation) are shown before and after the transformation. The
selected $\lambda$ for each feature was estimated through maximum likelihood.
Following the order from table \ref{tab:statistics-variables}, the values
were, approximately,  
-20.16, 12.58, -0.1, 0.29, 1.59, 0.81, -0.79, -1.69, 0.28, and 0.27.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{before_after_transform_gases.eps}
    \caption{Gases distribution before and after the power transform.}
    \label{fig:before-after-transform}
\end{figure*}
 
\subsubsection{Feature extraction}

The lag is a time gap in the series and are useful to analyse seasonality and trend. In
general, besides the influence of another variables, the past values can be
helpful to make good predictions. An exploratory study with autocorrelation
(ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) to define the number of lag
variables. Figure \ref{fig:acf-pacf} shows interesting patterns: CO has spikes
at 12 multiples. That indicates a high correlation with twelve hours
difference. The ozone does not have this quality, but presents the diary
spikes. It is interesting that at Bangu station, this is negatively related.
Since the PACF has only two spikes in all graphs, there is an autoregressive
term in the pollutants series of order two. We add two lag variables for each
pollutant and each monitoring station, then. We also add a 24 lag time to
catch the diary influence. Besides that, a rolling mean variable with a 24 lag
is added to simulate a moving average (MA) term. It is not possible to use the MA
model in this framework since they are not observed \cite{liang2020machine}. 

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{acf_pacf_gases.eps}
    \caption{ACF and PACF plots for CO, O$_3$, and PM$_{10}$ at Copacabana and
    Bangu stations. }
    \label{fig:acf-pacf}
\end{figure*}

Variables to remove: {\tt hour} since it is highly correlated with {\tt hour\_sin}, and {\tt Data}, because it has no service anymore. We will have
only numeric variables from now on. The total number of features after all
the above processes is 32 including meteorological conditions, time-related,
lags, moving averages, 
and pollutants measurements.

\begin{remark}
    The first 5 variables in PCA decomposition had more than 0.9 of explained
    variance. However, their $R^2$ score in Linear Regression was 0.616, much
    lower than the Linear Regression case explained posteriorly. For that
    reason, we ignore the reduced dataset by PCA.  
\end{remark}
