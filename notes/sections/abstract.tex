Air is an essential resource and its quality is important for the human being
and the environment. The ability to understand and predict air quality may
help to prevent events of poor quality and formulate environmental policies.
This work presents models for O$_3$, CO, and PM$_{10}$ for each monitoring
station in Rio de Janeiro. Machine learning methods, including linear
regression, support vector machine, and random forest produced promising
results for gases and AQI levels predictions.
