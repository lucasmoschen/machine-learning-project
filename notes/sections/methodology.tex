We utilize the Pearson correlation, the mean absolute error (MAE), the root
mean squared error (RMSE), and the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) as measures to
compare the models. The methods were trained using XXX\% of the available data,
which correspond to the period XXX. We also forecast of the air quality index
(AQI). The software used for performing this experimental phase was developed
in Python (version 3.9), mainly using the Pandas and Scikit-learn.
